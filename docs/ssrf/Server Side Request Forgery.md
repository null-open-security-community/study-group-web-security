# What is Server Side Request Forgery?
SSRF, or Server-Side Request Forgery, is a web vulnerability where an attacker can make a server send requests to other resources on the internet, often within a trusted network. This can potentially lead to unauthorized access to internal systems, data exposure, or abuse of services.

# How Impactful are SSRF Attacks?
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks can have a significant and wide-ranging impact on the security and functionality of web applications and systems. The severity of the impact depends on various factors, including the vulnerability's context, the level of access gained, and the attacker's intent. 

Here are the potential impacts of SSRF attacks:
1. Data Exposure: SSRF can allow attackers to access sensitive internal data such as configuration files, credentials, and databases. This exposure can lead to data breaches and compromises in data integrity and confidentiality.
2. Remote Code Execution: In some cases, SSRF can be leveraged to execute code on the internal server or interact with internal services, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system.
3. Abusing Internal Services: Attackers can abuse SSRF to target and abuse internal services, potentially overloading them or causing disruptions in critical operations.
4. Exploiting Infrastructure: SSRF can be used to perform reconnaissance on internal network infrastructure, identifying vulnerabilities for future attacks.
5. Bypassing Security Controls: SSRF can be used to bypass security controls by making requests to trusted internal systems, making it challenging to detect and mitigate the attack.
6. Server Abuse and Anonymization: Attackers can abuse SSRF to make requests to external services from the server, effectively anonymizing their activities and potentially implicating the targeted server in malicious actions.
7. Attack Chaining: SSRF can be part of a larger attack chain, where it's used to initiate or facilitate further attacks, such as accessing internal services to gather information for subsequent attacks.

# Types of SSRF Attacks:
## Common SSRF Attacks:
SSRF attacks happen when a sneaky hacker tricks a trusting website into doing things it shouldn't. The hacker uses this trust to go beyond the website and mess with other places, like secret parts of the internet or internal systems of a company, causing all sorts of trouble.

### SSRF Attacks Against the Server
In these types of attacks, the attacker causes the application to make an HTTP request back to the server that is hosting the application, via its loopback network interface.

*The loopback network interface is a special network interface on a computer that allows network communication to itself.*

**Example:** Imagine a shopping application that lets the user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store. To provide the information, the application must query its internal APIs. It does this by making another request to a relevant API endpoint through an HTTP request. A request similar to the following is made for carrying out this process:
```
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: xyz

stockApi=http://stock.shopwebsite.net:1711/product/stock/check%3FproductId%3D6%26storeId%3D1
```

Carefully look at the end of the stockApi line. It says `check%3FproductId%3D6%26storeId%3D1`, If you URL decode it, You can see it converts to `check?productId=6&storeId=1`. With this you can conclude that the stock at Store id 1 is being checked/retrieved for the product id 6.

Anyways, This causes the server to make request to the specified URL, then fetch and return the stock data.

In this example, An attacker can forge the request to specify a different URL than what was originally meant to be used. The modified HTTP request might look something like this: 
```
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: xyz

stockApi=http://localhost/admin
```

What happens here is that the data is fetched from the request and the URL to be fetched becomes `http://localhost/admin`. This causes the server to fetch data from `http://localhost/admin` and display it in result.

An attacker can visit `/admin` URL, but as the user is unauthenticated, the page won't be accessible. But when the same page is requested from within the server, the normal access controls are bypassed because the request appears to originate from a trusted location.

10. On visiting the link and we can see that we successfully loaded the admin page.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab1-10.png)

11. Now let's try deleting the `carlos` account.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab1-11.png)

12. As we can see that the action is not allowed. 

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab1-12.png)

13. Let's again edit the original request and check the response.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab1-13.png)

14. This time it responded with a `HTTP/2 302 FOUND` code.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab1-14.png)

15. As we can see the `Congratulations, you solved the lab!` message, we can conclude that we were successful at deleting `carlos` account.

### SSRF attacks against other back-end systems
In some cases, The server is able to interact with back-end systems that are not directly reachable by users. These systems often have non-routable private IP addresses. The back-end systems are normally protected by network topology, so they often have a weaker security posture. In many cases, internal back-end systems contain sensitive functionality that can be accessed without authentication by anyone who is able to interact with the systems.

Suppose there is an other server in the network at `192.168.0.12` which contains sensitive functionality that can be accessed without authentication by anyone able to interact with the system.

The following payload would work in such cases:
```
POST /product/stock HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 118

stockApi=http://192.168.0.12/admin
```

### [SSRF Lab 2 - Basic SSRF against another back-end system](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-basic-ssrf-against-backend-system)

Description of Lab:

```
This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal 192.168.0.X range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user carlos.
```

1. Access the lab.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-1.png)

2. Open any product's page.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-2.png)

3. Check the stock.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-3.png)

4. Look for the stock retrieval request in BurpSuite.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-4.png)

5. Send the request to repeater to tamper the request and test.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-5.png)

6. Let's now try editing the `stockApi` link in the request.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-6.png)

7. As we know from the description that the admin interface is at the server `192.168.0.x` at port `8080`. We need to try finding the `x`. Send the request to intruder.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-7.png)

8. Now in the Intruder tab, select the `1` in the `stockApi` link and press the Add button in the right side.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-8.png)

9. Now As the values can be anything from `1 to 255`, Let's copy the values `1 to 255` and go to the payloads tab. 
   ***Note:** What I've done here is echoed values from `1 to 255` and then used a tool **`xclip`** to copy the numbers to the clipboard by piping the output of loop into `xclip` command.*

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-9.png)

10. Now paste the copied payloads using the paste button in `Payload settings [Simple list]` and then press the `start attack` button. 

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-10.png)

11. Here you will see a request that stands out. This is how we get the value of `x`.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-11.png)

12. Now replace `x` with the payload and send the request with the URL which is used to delete an account.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab2-12.png)

13. Reloading the page, you can see the message `Congratulations, you solved the lab!`.

## Circumventing common SSRF defenses

Applications usually contain defence against SSRF attacks which are aimed at exploiting the application's internal trust structure. These defenses can be circumvented using different techniques which we will discuss below:

### SSRF with blacklist-based input filters
Some applications block input containing `hostnames` like `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, or sensitive URLs like /admin. In this situation, we can often bypass the security measures using the following techniques: 
- Use an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1`, such as `2130706433`, `017700000001`, `0177.0.0.1`, `0x7f.0.0.1`, `127.0.1`, `0x7f000001` or `127.1`.
- You can use any domain that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. One good example is `localtest.me` and all its subdomains except `readme.localtest.me`.
- Obfuscate blocked strings using URL encoding or case variation.
- Provide a URL that you control, which redirects to the target URL. Try using different redirect codes, as well as different protocols. For example, switching from an `http:` to `https:` URL during the redirect has been shown to bypass some anti-SSRF filters.

Enough theory. Let's Put this into practice **Right Now!**

### [SSRF Lab 3 - SSRF with blacklist-based input filter](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-blacklist-filter)

Description of Lab:

```
This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass. 
```

1. Access the lab and open any product's page.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-1.png)

2. Click on the `Check stock` button.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-2.png)


3. Look for the `Check stock` request in `BurpSuite` and try using alternative IP representations of `localhost` in place of the `stockApi` parameter value.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-3.png)

4. Let's try `http://127.1/admin` first.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-4.png)

Didn't work.

5. Let's now try retrieving `http://2130706433/admin`.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-5.png)

Didn't work!

6. Let's not try getting to the admin page ATM. Let's just try loading the index page, which would be situated at `127.1` and could be retrieved by `stockApi=http://127.1` .

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-6.png)

And we're successful loading the index page.

7. As we've tried `http://127.1/admin` in the 4th step, we won't try it again, The initial part of the URL works fine as we saw in the previous step. Let's now try encoding characters from the `/admin` part. Let's URL encode the `a` in the start of `/admin`.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-7.png)

Didn't Work.

8. Let's double encode the same. The `%` sign encodes to `%25`.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-8.png)

***This Worked!***

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-8-1.png)

Above we can see the deletion link for the user `carlos`. i.e. `/admin/delete?username=carlos`.

9. Let's now use the URL to try to delete the user `carlos` by editing the request.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab3-9.png)

10. And We're Done! `Congratulations, you solved the lab!`

### SSRF with whitelist-based input filters
Some applications only allow inputs that match, a whitelist of permitted values. The filter may look for a match at the beginning of the input, or contained within in it. You may be able to bypass this filter by exploiting inconsistencies in URL parsing.

The URL specification contains a number of features that are likely to be overlooked when an application implements ad-hoc(*just devise a singular solution that works for a specific problem in the situation you find yourself in.*) parsing and validation using this method:
- You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using the `@` character. For example: 
  `https://expected-host:fakepassword@evil-host`
- You can use the `#` character to indicate a URL fragment. For example:
  `https://evil-host#expected-host`
- You can leverage the DNS naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control. For example:
  `https://expected-host.evil-host`
- You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code. This is particularly useful if the code that implements the filter handles URL-encoded characters differently than the code that performs the back-end HTTP request. You can also try [double-encoding](https://portswigger.net/web-security/essential-skills/obfuscating-attacks-using-encodings#obfuscation-via-double-url-encoding) characters; some servers recursively URL-decode the input they receive, which can lead to further discrepancies.
- You can use combinations of these techniques together.


### [SSRF Lab 4 - SSRF with whitelist-based input filter](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-with-whitelist-filter)

Description of Lab:

```
This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed an anti-SSRF defense you will need to bypass. 
```

1. Access the lab.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-1.png)

2. Open any product page, click on the `Check stock` button.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-2.png)

3. Look for the `Check stock` request in the `HTTP history` tab and send it to repeater.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-3.png)

4. Let's try using different IP representation (i.e. `http://127.1`) instead of `localhost` for the `stockApi` parameter and check the results.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-4.png)

**Didn't Work**

5. Let's now try the `@` character, What this might do is think that we are passing a username so the link might get validated.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-5.png)

**Worked! Look at how the response differs from the previous one!**

6. Moving further, with further modifying the payload, Let's now try another `hack`. As we now know that we can use the `#` character for indicating a URL fragment. As we can see, the response changes back to like it was in 4th step. 

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-6.png)

 Remember how some links (Ex: `https://website.com/page#section`) takes you to the particular section of a webpage.

7. Let's try encoding the `#` character.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-7.png)

**No Luck!**

8. Let's Try Encoding It Again, And the `%23` becomes `%2523` after another round of encoding.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-8.png)

***This Worked!!!***

9. Now let's change the word `nimish` to `localhost` as it is supposed to be the `evil-host` that we're trying to access using SSRF.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-9.png)

**Congratlations, We got a Status code `200`!**

10. Let's now try loading the `admin` page.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-10.png)

**We're Successful!**

11. Now let's try deleting the `carlos` account as we've done in the previous labs.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab4-11.png)

12. And we're done, `Congratulations! you solved the lab!`.

### Bypassing SSRF filters via open redirection
Open redirection vulnerability can be sometimes used to bypass filter-based defenses. In the previous example, Let's suppose that the user submitted URL is strictly validated. i.e. the link should be  starting with `http://weliketoshop.net`. However the application whose URLs are allowed contains an open redirection vulnerability and the application redirects the user to the desired target.

For example, `/product/nectProduct?currentProductId=6&path=http://evil-user.net` would redirect the user to `http://evil-user.net`

We can leverage the open redirect vulnerability to bypass the URL filter, and exploit 

### [SSRF Lab 5 - SSRF with filter bypass via open redirection vulnerability](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/lab-ssrf-filter-bypass-via-open-redirection)

Description of Lab:

```
This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at `http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin` and delete the user carlos.

The stock checker has been restricted to only access the local application, so you will need to find an open redirect affecting the application first.
```

1. As always, access the lab.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab5-1.png)

2. Open up any product's page. Here we can see the links for `Next product`. Click on the `Next product` link.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab5-2.png)

3. Locate the specific request in BurpSuite.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab5-3.png)
As we can see, It takes us to the `Next product` using the `path=` parameter in the first line of the request. 

4. Let's now check for open redirection sending the request through `stockApi` parameter.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab5-4.png)
As we can see that the request doesn't respond with anything.

5. Let's now try encoding the characters and sending the request!

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab5-5.png)
*Again, No Luck*

6. Lets try encoding them again for one last time.

![image](./Attachments/SSRF-Lab5-6.png)
***And it Worked!***

7. Now let's use the same trick to delete the `carlos` account.
