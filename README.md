# Web Security Study Group
This is the repository for the study notes for the topic of Web Security.

## Usage
Create a branch, then create a new directory with your name and all your notes/study materials will be residing in there.<br>
Eg:
```shell
study-group-web-security/
├── KumarAshwin
│   ├── notes.md
│   └── reference_materials
└── README.md
```

The contributors will be working and pushing directly to their own branch (keep branch name same as your name), and at the end we will merge all into the main branch.

## Contributors
- Add your name with github profile linked to the name
